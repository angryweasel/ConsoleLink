There's no easy way with shell scripting to create a shortcut that has settings for console properties, such as screen colors, buffers, edit settings, etc.
This application works on a very narrow scope, but I'm open to enhancing it (or fixing bugs) as needed.

One known item is that I'm hard coding the color scheme to a blue background. I should make this a command line parameter, but haven't figured out a great way to do this. I suppose it will be something like background=blue, but I'm open for better ideas.
